# AI Voice Agent Usage Tracker - Admin Extension Documentation

## Overview

This documentation outlines the extension of the AI Voice Agent Usage Tracker application to include super admin functionality. The updated application now supports multiple admin users who can manage regular users, assign API keys, and view usage statistics across all users, while regular users can only view their own usage statistics without access to their API keys.

## Key Features Added

1. **Role-Based User Management**
   - Super admin role with ability to create and manage users
   - Secure user creation with email, phone, business name, and API key
   - User deactivation/reactivation capabilities

2. **Secure API Key Management**
   - Admin-only API key assignment and visibility
   - Encrypted API key storage
   - API key validation during assignment

3. **Enhanced Dashboard**
   - Admin dashboard with all-user statistics and filtering
   - Regular user dashboard with personal usage only
   - No API key visibility for regular users

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging of all admin actions
   - Secure, immutable audit trail

## Architecture Changes

### Database Schema Updates

The database schema has been extended to support:
- Role-based user management (admin vs. regular users)
- Separate API key storage with admin-only access
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Enhanced security rules for role-based access

See the [Updated Database Schema](./updated_database_schema.md) document for complete details.

### Authentication and Access Control

The authentication system has been enhanced to:
- Support role-based access control
- Protect admin routes from unauthorized access
- Securely manage API keys without exposing them to users
- Implement proper security measures for admin operations

See the [Authentication and RBAC](./authentication_and_rbac.md) document for implementation details.

### Admin Dashboard Design

A comprehensive admin dashboard has been designed to:
- Display all users and their status
- Provide user management capabilities
- Show usage statistics across all users
- Support filtering and detailed views

See the [Admin Dashboard Design](./admin_dashboard_design.md) document for UI/UX details.

## Implementation Details

### User Management

Admins can now:
- Create new users with all required information
- Assign ElevenLabs API keys during user creation
- Edit existing user information
- Deactivate/reactivate users
- Reset user passwords

The API key assignment process includes validation to ensure keys are valid before saving.

### API Key Security

API keys are:
- Encrypted before storage in the database
- Only visible to admin users
- Never exposed in client-side code
- Only decrypted when needed for API calls

### User Dashboard Updates

The regular user dashboard has been updated to:
- Remove any API key visibility or management
- Focus solely on usage statistics
- Provide a clean, intuitive interface
- Support mobile responsiveness

## Validation

A comprehensive validation plan has been created to ensure:
- All admin flows work as expected
- All user flows work as expected
- Security measures are properly implemented
- Edge cases are handled appropriately

See the [Validation Plan](./validation_plan.md) document for testing details.

## Migration Guide

To migrate from the previous version:

1. **Database Migration**
   - Add role field to existing users (default to "user")
   - Create an initial admin user
   - Move existing API keys to the new apiKeys collection
   - Update security rules

2. **Code Updates**
   - Replace authentication components with new role-based versions
   - Update dashboard components to reflect new permissions
   - Add admin components for user management

3. **Testing**
   - Validate all flows as outlined in the validation plan
   - Ensure existing users can still access their data
   - Verify security measures are working correctly

## Security Considerations

The updated application includes several security enhancements:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Enforced at both client and server levels
   - Protected routes and API endpoints

2. **API Key Protection**
   - Encrypted storage
   - Admin-only visibility
   - Secure usage in API calls

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging of admin actions
   - Immutable audit trail

4. **Session Management**
   - Secure admin sessions
   - Appropriate timeouts and protections

## Conclusion

The AI Voice Agent Usage Tracker has been successfully extended to support super admin functionality, allowing for secure management of users and their ElevenLabs API keys. The updated application maintains a clean separation between admin and user capabilities, ensuring that regular users can only view their usage statistics without access to sensitive information like API keys.

This extension provides a scalable foundation for managing multiple users with different ElevenLabs API keys, while maintaining security and usability for all user types.
