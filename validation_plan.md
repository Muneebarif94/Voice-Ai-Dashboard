# Admin and User Flow Validation

This document outlines the validation process for both admin and user flows in the updated AI Voice Agent Usage Tracker application with super admin functionality.

## Admin Flows

### 1. Admin Authentication Flow

**Expected Behavior:**

- [ ] Verify that non-admin users cannot access admin routes

### 2. User Management Flow

**Expected Behavior:**
- Admin can view list of all users
- Admin can add new users with all required fields
- Admin can edit existing user information
- Admin can deactivate/reactivate users

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] View user list and verify all users are displayed
- [ ] Create new user with all fields and verify in database
- [ ] Edit user information and verify changes persist
- [ ] Deactivate a user and verify they cannot log in
- [ ] Reactivate a user and verify they can log in again
- [ ] Reset a user's password and verify they receive email

### 3. API Key Management Flow

**Expected Behavior:**
- Admin can assign API keys to users during creation
- Admin can view and update API keys for existing users
- API keys are securely stored and never exposed in client-side code
- API key validation works correctly

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Assign API key during user creation and verify it works
- [ ] View API key for existing user (admin only)
- [ ] Update API key for a user and verify changes
- [ ] Verify API key is not visible in browser network requests
- [ ] Verify API key validation correctly identifies valid/invalid keys

### 4. Usage Statistics Dashboard Flow

**Expected Behavior:**
- Admin can view usage statistics for all users
- Admin can filter statistics by user
- Admin can refresh data to get latest statistics
- Statistics are accurate and match ElevenLabs data

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] View dashboard with statistics for all users
- [ ] Filter statistics by specific user
- [ ] Refresh data and verify it updates
- [ ] Compare statistics with ElevenLabs dashboard for accuracy

## User Flows

### 1. User Authentication Flow

**Expected Behavior:**
- User can log in with email/password
- System recognizes user role and redirects to user dashboard
- User-only navigation options are visible
- User cannot access admin routes

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Log in with user credentials
- [ ] Verify redirect to user dashboard
- [ ] Confirm only user navigation options are visible
- [ ] Attempt to access admin routes and verify access is denied

### 2. User Dashboard Flow

**Expected Behavior:**
- User can view their own usage statistics
- User cannot see their API key
- User can refresh data to get latest statistics
- Statistics are accurate and match ElevenLabs data

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] View dashboard and verify statistics are displayed
- [ ] Verify API key is not visible anywhere in the UI
- [ ] Refresh data and verify it updates
- [ ] Compare statistics with ElevenLabs dashboard for accuracy

### 3. User Profile Management Flow

**Expected Behavior:**
- User can view their profile information
- User can update allowed profile fields
- User cannot change their role or API key
- User can change their password

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] View profile information and verify accuracy
- [ ] Update allowed fields and verify changes persist
- [ ] Verify role and API key fields are not editable
- [ ] Change password and verify it works for next login

## Security Validation

### 1. Role-Based Access Control

**Expected Behavior:**
- Admin routes are protected from non-admin users
- User data is protected from other users
- API keys are only accessible to admins

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Attempt to access admin routes as regular user
- [ ] Attempt to access other users' data as regular user
- [ ] Verify API keys are not exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Check Firebase security rules enforce proper access control

### 2. API Key Security

**Expected Behavior:**
- API keys are encrypted in the database
- API keys are never sent to the client for regular users
- API calls use the correct user's API key without exposing it

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Verify API keys are stored encrypted in Firestore
- [ ] Inspect network requests to ensure API keys are not visible
- [ ] Verify API calls succeed with the correct user context
- [ ] Test API key rotation and verify it works correctly

### 3. Audit Logging

**Expected Behavior:**
- All admin actions are logged
- Logs include admin ID, action, target user, and timestamp
- Logs cannot be modified or deleted

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Perform various admin actions and verify logs are created
- [ ] Check log entries for completeness of information
- [ ] Attempt to modify logs and verify it's not possible
- [ ] Verify logs are only visible to admins

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

### 1. Invalid API Keys

**Expected Behavior:**
- System detects invalid API keys during validation
- Appropriate error messages are displayed
- Users with invalid API keys see clear error messages

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Test with invalid API key format
- [ ] Test with expired or revoked API key
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear and actionable

### 2. Network Issues

**Expected Behavior:**
- System handles network failures gracefully
- Appropriate error messages are displayed
- Retry mechanisms work as expected

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Test with network disconnection
- [ ] Test with slow network connection
- [ ] Verify error messages and retry options

### 3. Concurrent Access

**Expected Behavior:**
- System handles multiple admins editing the same user
- Last write wins or appropriate conflict resolution
- No data corruption occurs

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Simulate concurrent edits by multiple admins
- [ ] Verify data integrity is maintained
- [ ] Check for appropriate warnings or locks

## Mobile Responsiveness
